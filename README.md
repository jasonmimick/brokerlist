# OSB Broker List

This repository contains a list of OSB compatible service brokers. We've listed
brokers here that we believe are stable and we've seen used in production.

Below is a list of brokers.

* [Openshift Ansible Service Broker](https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker)
* [Service Broker for Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcp-service-broker)
* [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure)

Note: this list is not sponsored by any individual corporation, and the ordering of
the brokers in the list does not indicate preference or priority.
