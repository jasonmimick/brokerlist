# Why?

We work on several open service broker related projects and have heard quite
a few folks asking if there's a list of brokers that they can choose from for
their application.

We're trying to keep track of useful brokers in this repository so that folks
can check this list for brokers they might want to use. But, we aren't
attempting to track every broker in existence.
